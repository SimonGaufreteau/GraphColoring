# Graph Coloring

## About the project

A simple project aiming at implementing the most common graph algorithms on 2 subjects :

- Graph coloring : Greedy, DSATUR, Welsh-Powell
- Minimum Spanning tree : Kruskal, Prim and an approximation to the Degree-constrained Minimum Spanning tree (or D-MST)

## How to use

Just build the project and start the main method in the Main class.

If you want to try different algorithms, take a look at the Algorithms class. 
You can extract a graph from a .col or a .mst file with the GraphParser class (example in the code and in the test/graphs directory).

## Set up

Java JDK 13 / Intellij
